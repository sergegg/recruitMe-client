### How To
In order to use this application locally. Fork and clone this repo using the Fork button on the top right of the page. Then, clone it using the green "Code" button, choose SSH, and copy into your terminal using 'git clone -->SSH tag<--'. Following that, you may run grunt serve to view this applicaiton on your own local server. Then follow the "How To" on the backend repo to fork and clone the API repo.

Otherwise, if you would like to use the deployed application, just head over to the deployed site provided in the "about" section of this repo, sign up using a fake emnail and password containing at least 5 characters, sign-in, and begin using the site!

### Planning Story
While considering creating this front-end, I wanted to create something elegant
and simple. I wanted to create something which allowed users to enter a website
and be able to dive in to reviewing others profiles or creating/editing their own.
I knew I had to start by developing a website that allowed the simple functionality
first such as the sign-in/up etc. I then wanted to allow a user to create a profile and
to be able to edit and update and delete a profile/post before allowing comments.

### Development Process
I began reviewing a lot of material that I learned during the last session of the
course. I then followed up by designing the bare bones of the HTML to allow basic
functionality and basic CRUD actions on Users and then on created Profiles. Following
that I planned out the comment look on the posts and the functionality to allow Users
to crud on created comments which are in posts.

### Technologies Used to Complete Front-End

### Strategy to Solve Problems
My strategy to solve problems was reffering to the documintation, referring to
the lesson videos, and also referring to videos and articles written online by
other people who experienced similiar issues to mine or had similiar experiences.

### Unsolved Problems
I have yet to create a Comment model. I am also having a few issues communicating
with the back-end when it comes to creating ID's on the backend in order to
send them to the front-end to crud on created profiles.

Please note, it is still under development
